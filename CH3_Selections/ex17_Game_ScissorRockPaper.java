/**
 * (Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rockpaper
 game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can
 wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing
 scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or
 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses,
 or draws. Here are sample runs:
    scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
    The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won

    scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 2
    The computer is paper. You are paper too. It is a draw
