 * (Financial: compare costs) Suppose you shop for rice in two different packages.
 You would like to write a program to compare the cost. The program prompts the
 user to enter the weight and price of the each package and displays the one with
 the better price. Here is a sample run:

 Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 24.59
 Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 11.99
 Package 2 has a better price.

 Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 25
 Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 12.5
 Two packages have the same price.
